Upgrade Requirement:
We are going to implement the 'prevent overbooking' functionality is a simpler way:
I have created a new checkbox field for Course-Event in Sandbox called "Fully Booked".
When this field is ticked (by manual intervention rather than by a calculated field) then the website List of Courses should replace the "Book Now" link with "Not Available" and display an "i" message: "This course is now fully booked. Ring the Lismullin Office for further information".

File List:
	soapclient/sfclient.php
	soapclient/course.php
	views/courses/tmpl/default.php
	views/courses/view.html.php
	assets/css/salesforce.css
